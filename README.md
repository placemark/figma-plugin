![Figma plugin preview](./splash.png)

Make maps in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
data. This plugin directly transforms live OpenStreetMap into a vector map in Figma.
It's similar in spirit, technically, to the renderer in [iD](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD),
but much simpler.

## Development

The `build` script will continuously build and update this plugin.

You can use this plugin locally by going
to Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest…

## Usage

Create an empty frame in Figma. With it selected, start the Placemark plugin.
Select an area, click **Render**.
